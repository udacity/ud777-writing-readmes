# Writing READMEs README

Udacity's course _Writing READMEs_ explains the importance of documenting your work. Here, you can find some supplemental resources for writing good READMEs.

## Resources

* [Choose A License](http://choosealicense.com/) - Helpful website for picking out a license for your project.
* [Github flavored markdown reference](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) - Github own documentation about documentation

## Sample READMEs

* [Udacity Feedback Chrome Extension](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-grading-engine) - A front-end grading engine built by Cameron Pittman, a content developer at Udacity. The documentation is thorough and complete, so anybody can use it!
* [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) - An open source project maintained by thoughtbot. Great example of simple instructions to get you set up, which then links to external documentation.
* [can.viewify](https://github.com/zkat/can.viewify) - Awesome example of someone documenting her personal projects concisely.
* [create-your-own-adventure](https://github.com/udacity/create-your-own-adventure) - This README for Udacity's Git and Github course
